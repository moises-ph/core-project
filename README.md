# Core-Project of the Motoko Bootcamp 2023

This project was made with the basic requeriments, I wanted to do the aditional requeriments for the project but the time wasn't enough for that all.

So I made all the code based on my knoyledges in Backend, I apologize in advice for the code, it can has a few "ugly" thinks but with the time and practice with Motoko Language my level and skills will Increase.

Thank you for teaching me this language and for showing me this worl of the IC, blockchain, smart-contracts, etc.

I made the interface my myself, I hope you like it and that's it.
